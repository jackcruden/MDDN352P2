You'll be prompted to allow access to your location, the latitude and longitude info are sent to [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) to get an accurate weather forecast. 

Weather Lad was created as a concept web app for the MDDN352 paper at Victoria University of Wellington.

It utilises the browser [geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) to get the location of the user then uses the [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) API to fetch the weather forecast. It interprets some user input like "what is the weather tomorrow?" and "what about friday?" to respond with the queried day's forecast. Weather Lad was designed as a mobile experience but uses some responsive design techniques to show and hide data when appropriate.

I also created a unique set of GIFs in After Effects to show the weather status.
